# Week 2 Learnings

## What we built
- **Query Rewriter**: LLM-based module for resolving coreference and topic shifts in conversational queries
- **RRF Generator**: Reciprocal Rank Fusion combining BM25 and vector search for diverse candidate sets
- **Cross-Encoder Reranker**: Precision-focused reranking using ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 model
- **MMR Deduplicator**: Maximal Marginal Relevance for selecting diverse, non-redundant documents
- **RL Environment**: Complete state/action/reward framework for training retrieval policies
- **Episode Runner**: Random, greedy, and epsilon-greedy policies for testing and data collection

## What worked
- **Cross-encoder reranking**: Successfully loaded and ran ms-marco model, improving precision
- **MMR deduplication**: Working diversity selection with configurable lambda parameters
- **Modular architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces
- **Apple Silicon compatibility**: Models run on MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) for good performance

## What didn't work (yet)
- **Query rewriting**: Requires OpenAI API key setup (expected for LLM components)
- **RL environment imports**: Relative import issues need fixing for full integration
- **RRF generator**: Needs integration with existing BM25/vector scripts
- **Full pipeline**: End-to-end integration pending import fixes

## Technical insights
- **Model loading**: Sentence-transformers models load quickly on Apple Silicon
- **Cross-encoder performance**: Significant score differences (7.390 vs 0.8) show strong reranking capability
- **MMR effectiveness**: Successfully selects diverse documents (relevance scores 1.000, 0.800)
- **Memory usage**: Models fit comfortably in available RAM

## Architecture decisions
- **Modular design**: Each component can be tested and used independently
- **Configurable parameters**: Lambda values, model choices, and thresholds are tunable
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when components fail
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Next steps (Week 3)
- [ ] Fix import issues in RL environment and episode runner
- [ ] Integrate RRF generator with existing BM25/vector scripts
- [ ] Set up OpenAI API key for query rewriting testing
- [ ] Run full end-to-end pipeline on CORAL data
- [ ] Implement behavioral cloning data collection
- [ ] Add reward model integration

## Performance metrics
- **Cross-encoder**: 39.11 it/s batch processing
- **MMR**: 80.37 it/s embedding computation
- **Model loading**: ~5 seconds for cross-encoder, ~1.3 seconds for MMR
- **Memory**: Efficient usage on Apple Silicon

## Code quality
- **Type hints**: Comprehensive typing throughout
- **Error handling**: Try-catch blocks with fallbacks
- **Documentation**: Docstrings and comments for all major functions
- **Testing**: Individual component tests with clear pass/fail criteria

## Dependencies added
- `openai>=1.0.0` - For query rewriting
- `sentence-transformers>=2.2.0` - For cross-encoder and MMR
- `torch>=1.9.0` - For model inference
- `faiss-cpu>=1.7.0` - For vector search (when integrated)
