# LEADR: Learning to Enhance Answer Diversity and Relevance

**LEADR** is a reinforcement learning framework for improving conversational RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems. The project implements a "Retrieve-then-Rerank" pipeline with RL agents that learn to select diverse, relevant documents to improve answer quality, faithfulness, and novelty.

## 🎯 Project Overview

LEADR addresses key challenges in conversational RAG:
- **Coreference resolution** in multi-turn conversations
- **Document diversity** to avoid redundant information
- **Precision at top-K** through intelligent reranking
- **Reward-driven learning** for optimal document selection

### Key Components

- **Query Rewriter**: Resolves pronouns and references using conversation history
- **RRF Generator**: Combines BM25 and vector search via Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- **Cross-Encoder Reranker**: Precision-focused reranking with pre-trained models
- **MMR Deduplicator**: Maximal Marginal Relevance for diverse document selection
- **RL Environment**: State/action/reward framework for policy learning
- **Episode Runner**: Random, greedy, and epsilon-greedy policies for training

## 🚀 Quickstart (Data → Index → Query)

1) Download CORAL raw files
```bash
python3 scripts/data_preparation/download_coral.py
```

2) Prepare corpus for indexing
```bash
python3 scripts/data_preparation/prepare_coral_corpus.py
```

3) Build indexes
```bash
# BM25
python3 scripts/data_preparation/build_bm25.py

# Vector (Sentence-Transformers); will fallback to sklearn if FAISS is unavailable
python3 scripts/data_preparation/build_faiss.py --model sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```

4) Run queries
```bash
# BM25
python3 scripts/week1/query_bm25.py "who won the fa cup" --k 3

# Vector
python3 scripts/week1/query_vector.py "who won the fa cup" --k 3
```

Data is stored under `data/coral/`, and indexes under `index/`.

## 📁 Scripts Organization

## RAG Fusion CLI (BM25 + Vector via RRF)

Combine BM25 and vector search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion:
```bash
python3 scripts/week1/rag_rrf.py "who won the fa cup" --k 5
```

## Generator via OpenRouter (Grok 3 Mini)

1) Create an OpenRouter API key and export it
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
```

2) Generate an answer using RRF retrieval + Grok 3 Mini
```bash
python3 scripts/generate_openrouter.py "who won the fa cup" --k 5 --max_tokens 256
```

## Generator via OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini)

1) Set your OpenAI key
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

2) Generate using gpt-4o-mini
```bash
python3 scripts/generate_openai.py "who won the fa cup" --k 5 --max_tokens 256
```

## Environment variables (.env)

Create a `.env` (not committed) at repo root:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
```
Scripts auto-load `.env` if `python-dotenv` is installed. Otherwise, export the variables in your shell.

## 🧠 Week 2: RL Environment & Advanced Reranking

### Cross-Encoder Reranker

The cross-encoder reranker improves precision by jointly encoding query-document pairs:

```python
from src.reranker.cross_encoder import CrossEncoderReranker

# Initialize with pre-trained model
reranker = CrossEncoderReranker(
    model_name="cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2",  # Default
    alpha=0.7  # Weight for combining scores
)

# Rerank candidates
candidates = [
    {"doc_id": "doc1", "content": "Arsenal won the FA Cup...", "rrf_score": 0.8},
    {"doc_id": "doc2", "content": "The FA Cup is an annual...", "rrf_score": 0.6}
]

reranked = reranker.rerank_candidates("Who won the FA Cup in 2020?", candidates)
```

### Available Pre-trained Models

```python
from src.reranker.pretrained_models import get_recommended_models, list_all_models

# Get recommended models for different use cases
general_models = get_recommended_models("general")  # MS MARCO models
qa_models = get_recommended_models("qa")           # Natural Questions models
multilingual_models = get_recommended_models("multilingual")  # XLM-R models

# List all available models
list_all_models()
```

**Recommended Models:**
- `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` - **Default**: Good speed/quality balance
- `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2` - **Better quality**: Larger model
- `cross-encoder/nq-distilbert-base-v1` - **Q&A focused**: Natural Questions trained

### MMR Deduplication

Maximal Marginal Relevance selects diverse documents:

```python
from src.reranker.mmr import MMRDeduplicator

mmr = MMRDeduplicator()
selected = mmr.select_diverse_documents(
    query="Football players and achievements",
    candidates=candidates,
    lambda_mmr=0.5,  # Balance relevance vs diversity
    top_k=5
)
```

### RL Environment

Run episodes with different policies:

```python
from src.env.rag_environment import RAGEnvironment
from src.policy.episode_runner import EpisodeRunner, PolicyConfig

# Initialize environment
env = RAGEnvironment(
    max_steps=5,
    k_candidates=100,
    use_cross_encoder=True,
    use_mmr=True
)

# Run episode with random policy
runner = EpisodeRunner(env)
policy_config = PolicyConfig(policy_type="random", selection_strategy="random")
episode = runner.run_episode("Who won the FA Cup in 2020?", policy_config)
```

### Testing Components

```bash
# Test individual components
python scripts/test_week2_simple.py

# Test with verbose output
python scripts/test_week2_simple.py --verbose
```
